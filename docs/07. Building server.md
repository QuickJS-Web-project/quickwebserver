# Building server
As you know, QuickJS allows you to compile JS code into a 
native application. This means that you can compile your 
server too.

To do this, pass your script as an input argument to the 
compiler:

```bash
qjsc -flto -o mysite mysite.js
```

You will see a message like this:
```bash
Warning: binary module './libqws.so' will be dynamically loaded
```

That means that you need to store file `libqws.so` near your
executable. 

It is located in the installed library folder inside 
`node_modules` (if using NPM) or in the folder where you 
cloned the repository.

Just copy it along with the compiled server application.
